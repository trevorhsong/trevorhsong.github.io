          My research is in the areas of optimization and machine learning, with applications in transportation and public policy. My current focus is to scale traditional optimization and machine learning algorithms to real world problems involving large datasets. I had the pleasure to partner with <a href="https://www.bostonpublicschools.org/">Boston Public School</a> to optimize their <a href="http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/print/WSJ_-A002-20170812.pdf">bus routes</a> and <a href="https://apps.bostonglobe.com/ideas/graphics/2018/09/equity-machine/">school start times</a>, a work that was selected as an Edelman award finalist. See my <a href="{{ site.currentresume }}">CV</a>, <a href="research.html">papers</a> and  <a href="media.html">media coverage</a> for more information.

        <p>I completed a PhD at the MIT Operations Research Center in 2019, under the supervision of <strong><a href="http://web.mit.edu/dbertsim/www/">Dimitris Bertsimas</a></strong> and
          <strong><a href="http://web.mit.edu/jaillet/www/">Patrick Jaillet</a></strong>. Prior to joining MIT, I graduated from <a href="https://www.polytechnique.edu/">Ecole polytechnique</a> (class X2011) with a MS degree in Applied Mathematics.</p>

          <li>In September 2018, I <a href="https://apps.bostonglobe.com/ideas/graphics/2018/09/equity-machine/">collaborated</a> with the Boston Globe and Boston Public Schools to study the impact of changing the start times in Boston, with a potential for $18M in yearly savings for the district, better student health and equity.</li>
          <li>In Spring 2017, I won the $30K <a href="https://www.bostonpublicschools.org/transportationchallenge">Boston Public Schools Transportation Challenge</a> together with <a href="https://adelarue.github.io/">Arthur Delarue</a> and Dimitris Bertsimas. 
          Our bus routing algorithm is now implemented and <b>we are routing tens of thousands of students to school every day</b>. It saves $5M dollars every year, reallocated to better serve the children of Boston.</li>
          <li>I worked as a software engineer intern at <strong>Google</strong> in Summer 2016, developing novel algorithms
              to improve maps and navigation data using large geolocation datasets (> 100Gb). </li>
          <li>In 2014, I was a visiting researcher for five months in <strong>UC Berkeley</strong> under <a href="http://bayen.eecs.berkeley.edu">Pr. Alexandre Bayen</a> supervision.</li>
