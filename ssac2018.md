# Workshop Material: Optimization with JuMP in Julia

## Following along
- If you have **never used Julia before**, you can access the **slides and code [here](assets/optimization_jump_julia.slides.html)**.
- If you know how to use Julia, the IJulia notebook that is used for this workshop is available in the GitGub repository: [https://github.com/sebmart/optimization_jump_julia](https://github.com/sebmart/optimization_jump_julia).

## Running the notebook/slides

All the materials used for this workshop is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/sebmart/optimization_jump_julia).
- The presentation and standalone code are merged into a notebook (Jupyter): [https://github.com/sebmart/optimization_jump_julia/blob/master/optimization_jump_julia.ipynb].
- The notebook can be viewed on the web, or opened with Julia using the `IJulia` package to be able to run the code and use its interactive features.
- The slides are contained in the notebook: they can be accessed using [RISE](https://damianavila.github.io/RISE/). They can be also be viewed without Julia [here](assets/optimization_jump_julia.slides.html), with the interactive features disabled.

## To go further and learn Julia

The notebook contains a large appendix that can be used as an introduction to coding in Julia and to use IJulia notebooks.

To get started:
- Install Julia (you can start [here](https://julialang.org/downloads/)).
- Follow *Appendix 1* of the notebook (see slides) for further instructions.
